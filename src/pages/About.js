                            I started coding in the mid 80s with my Texas Instrument TI-99 console. I cracked open the user manual and started my first coding project. After spending
                            hours coding lines of BASIC, I was thrileed to make a 16-bit Mr. Bojangles dance.

                            Over the years, I've enjoyed punching-up Ebay listings for family members and customizing websites for small
                            businesses. I may even be known to have replaced a motherboard once upon a time. I still enjoy taking things apart
                            and putting them back together.

                            When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer, I love exploring new hiking trails, getting grounded on my yoga mat,
                            escaping into a mystery novel, sampling new recipes in the kitchen and figuring out ways to make my kids
                            laugh.
